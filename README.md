```

## Usage

Register commander as follows

```ts
import { Comander } from "sca-command";

const commandManager = await Commander.start();
```

To create a command

```ts
export class AwesomeCommand extends BaseCommand<TData> {
	public commandName(): string {
		return "awesome-command";
	}

	public async commandAction(commandArguments: KeyValueArgument[], flags: string[]): Promise<void> {
		console.log("This is an awesome command"); // This is an awesome command

		console.log("Command arguments: ", commandArguments);

		console.log("Command flags: ", flags);
	}
}
```

To register command:

```ts
commandManager.registerCommands([
	import("@/somewhere/in/app/awesome.command"),
])
```

Register entry point for commands in `package.json`:

```json lines
{
  //
  "scripts": {
    "my-app": "node dist/index.js awesome-command"
  }
}
```

To run the command manager:
